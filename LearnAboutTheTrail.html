				Try taking a journey by covered wagon across 2000 miles of plains, rivers, and mountains. Try! On the plains, will you slosh your oxen through mud and water-filled ruts or will you plod through dust six inches deep?
			</div>
			<div id="page2" class="centerBox">
				How will you cross the rivers? If you have money, you might take a ferry (if there is a ferry). Or, you can ford the river and hope you and your wagon aren't swallowed alive!
			</div>
			<div id="page3" class="centerBox">
				What about supplies? Well, if you're low on food you can fish. You might get trout...you might. And there is salmon in the mountains.
			</div>
			<div id="page4" class="centerBox">
				At the Dalles, you can try navigating the Columbia River, but if running the rapids with a makeshift raft makes you queasy, better take the Barlow Road.
			</div>
			<div id="page5" class="centerBox">
				If for some reason you don't survive -- your wagon burns, or thieves steal your oxen, or you run out of provisions, or you die of cholera -- don't give up! Try again...and again...until your name is up with the others on the Oregon Top Ten.
